Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. 
Current diabetes management methods lack integration and accessibility, leading to poor control and increased health risks. Additionally, a reliable diabetes prediction system is needed to identify at-risk individuals early. An integrated solution combining a Diabetes Prediction System with an Insulin Dosage Calculator, Logging System, and personalized diet and exercise recommendations is necessary to empower users in managing their diabetes effectively

Aim and Objective:
The aim of this project is to develop a robust web-based platform that revolutionizes diabetes management by offering an insulin dosage calculator, a comprehensive logging system, and a diabetes prediction system. Based on the predicted diabetes risk, this system will provide Diet and Exercise Routine Recommendations. Its streamlineâ€™s insulin dosage calculations, enhance tracking capabilities. ultimately empowering individuals with diabetes to take control of their health. Platform aims to build trust among users, encouraging widespread adoption and facilitating improved health outcomes for individuals managing diabetes.
It also provides information about diabetes types, insulin types and further information.
